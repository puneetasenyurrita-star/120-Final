## Summary
This final project aims to show my audience of peers and instructor how I incorporate math programming and software relevant to our valuable class gained skills and knowledge to further my research in analyzing music data through different comparisons. Specifically, I used Rihanna's music albums for 3 different comparisons to figure out what her music is speaking and expressing and potentially why and how she does. The key questions I explored were, "How does sentiment change across Rihanna's different music albumns?", "How do stopwords impact different albums of Rihanna's music?", and "Do the top keywords show a recurring theme in different albums of Rihanna's?". This topic matters because music is everywhere and it being a huge part of our lives, it is essential to note how are artist express themselves and why they do it along with how they are doing it making them a unique element to explore and study.
