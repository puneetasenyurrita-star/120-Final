1. Introduction: 
The questions I explored were, "How does sentiment change across Rihanna's different music albumns?", "How do stopwords impact different albums of Rihanna's music?", and "Do the top keywords show a recurring theme in different albums of Rihanna's?".

-This topic matters because music is everywhere and it being a huge part of our lives, it is essential to note how are artist express themselves and why they do it along with how they are doing it making them a unique element to explore and study. 

-My dataset includes all of Rihanna's albums.

-Methods I used were tokenization, iteration, sorting, plot functions for visuals, the VADER sentiment analyzer, file upload, index-based process, classes and objects.

5: CONCLUSION: This final project will show my audience of peers and instructor that I incorporate math programming and software to gain insight in analyzing music data through different comparisons. Specifically, I am using Rihanna's music albums. By doing this, I will be analyzing across her albums, how sentiment changes, how stopwords impact them, and how the most occuring keywords play a role.
